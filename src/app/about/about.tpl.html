    Ever since Android came out, I wanted to build a geolocation
    app. Well, I'm finally getting around to doing it.
  </p>

  <h2>What's so special about this app?</h2>
  <p>
    There are plenty of apps which will show me what is around me.
    Generic places like museums, restaurants, etc. Google Now is 
    really good for this. What they don't show me are the places *I* 
    want to see: that cool little curio shop in SoHo, the sushi
    restaurant I heard about in the NY Times, that art show I read
    about on BoingBoing.
  </p>
    
  <p>
    That's what this app does. You type in the interesting places
    and events you want to visit the next time you're in that area
    and this app will show you them without the clutter of other apps.
